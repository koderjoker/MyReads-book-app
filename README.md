# MyReads Project

The following project uses 
* The JavaScript Library `react` 
* The `react` toolchain `create-react-app` 
* `react-router` package for routing
* The Udacity API

It allows the the user to build a book list of their own with books separated according to whether the user is currently reading a book, wants to read a book or has read a book.


## To run on system
* Clone repository locally
* Ensure you have installed `Node.js` and `npm` on your system else run `npm install npm -g`
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`


## Navigation
* Books are listed under Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read on the home page
* To change a book's status click on the green drop down button on the bottom right of a book cover. Clicking on None removes the book from the list
* To add new books, click on the green plus button at the bottom right of the home page, which will guide you to the search page . Books can be searched by title or author (Available search terms are as mentioned in SEARCH_TERMS.md). Then select the book of your choice by changing its status as explained above. 


### Note
* Built on starter code from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
* General ideas for implementation taken from Udacity's react section, react's and react-router's documentation and Udacity's webinars
